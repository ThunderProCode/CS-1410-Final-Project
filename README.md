# Restaurant Management System

The Restaurant Ordering System is a console-based application that facilitates seamless ordering and management processes within a restaurant. Customers can view the menu, customize their orders, place them, and make payments. The system keeps track of the order status, allowing customers to monitor the progress of their orders. Additionally, the application supports menu management for staff, enabling them to add, update, and remove menu items. The project emphasizes object-oriented design principles, with classes representing items, orders, menus, customers, and payments. The system provides an interactive and user-friendly console interface to streamline the ordering experience.
